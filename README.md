This is the eleventh day project that is part of the Udemy Course: 100 days of code- the complete Python Pro bootcamp, taught by Angela Yu. 

It is a blackjack game that aims to beat the dealer’s hand without going over 21. In Blackjack, every player is competing against the dealer—not each other. In a given round, the player’s ultimate goal is to get a hand that’s higher than the dealer’s (without being higher than 21, or "busting"). Only by beating the dealer can a player win their bet. Players determine the value of their hand by tallying up the point values of their cards:

*2 through 10: The number listed on the card (e.g., 2 is worth 2 points)

*Jack, Queen, King: 10 points

*Ace: 1 or 11 points (the player gets to choose)

*An Ace and a 10, Jack, Queen, or King equals 21 points and is known as a Blackjack.

I am extremely pleased to complete this project, because I confess it was a bit difficult for me to complete. It involved several subjects studied so far, such as while loops, flags, recursion, function, logical operators, conditional operators,random module... I was really able to put everything I leanerd into practice.
