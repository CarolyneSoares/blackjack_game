This is the tenth day project that is part of Course: 100 days of code- the complete Python Pro bootcamp. It is a blackjack game that aims to beat the dealer’s hand without going over 21.
In Blackjack, every player is competing against the dealer—not each other. In a given round, the player’s ultimate goal is to get a hand that’s higher than the dealer’s (without being higher than 21, or "busting"). Only by beating the dealer can a player win their bet. Players determine the value of their hand by tallying up the point values of their cards:

   - 2 through 10: The number listed on the card (e.g., 2 is worth 2 points)
     
    -Jack, Queen, King: 10 points
    
    -Ace: 1 or 11 points (the player gets to choose)
    
    -An Ace and a 10, Jack, Queen, or King equals 21 points and is known as a Blackjack.

I confess that it was difficult to complete this project, it involved several subjects studied so far, como while loops, flags, recursion, function, logical operators, conditional, operator,random module..I was really able to put everything I leanerd into practice.
